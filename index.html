<h3>Shopping</h3>

<p>Spending your cash and ogling the latest designs is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon, but surely you should be working out at the gym or doing 100 squats instead? Well, although shopping isn’t the most strenuous of activities, it is in fact good for you. Shopping, according to a study published in the Journal of Psychology and Marketing, gives us much-needed mood boosts and was described as being <b>‘overwhelmingly beneficial’</b> for our frame of mind by researchers.</p>

<h3>SQL (programming language)
</h3>
<blockquote cite = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL> Defination source
  Structured Query Language)[5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data 
  held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream 
  management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations
  among entities and variables.SQL offers two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM.
   Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates
    the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
